## Description
2D real-time multiplayer game in a browser.
Players divided in two teams play a football match on field with two goal posts.
Goal of the game is for a team to score 3 points before the other team.

This game showcases the usability of [wasm-peers](https://github.com/wasm-peers/wasm-peers#readme) crate for easy and costless peer-2-peer WebRTC communication.

Check the hosted game [here](http://wasm-peers-footballers.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).

## Functionality
Game supports any number of players, but at least 2 are necessary to start the game.
Players connect by providing session id received by some means from the game host.
This host is responsible for receiving players input, calculating game state and sending updated state to all connected players.

On the field, players can collide with each other and the ball, they can shoot the ball if they are close enough.
If one of the teams scores a goal, by bringing the ball across the goal posts, the score is updated and the game is reset.

## Local development
To run the game locally you must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) installed.

Signaling server from wasm-peer project should be running on `0.0.0.0:9001`.
See [here](https://github.com/wasm-peers/wasm-peers/tree/main/signaling-server) for instructions.

For now, only env variable without the default is the signaling server address
in production, it should be some publicly available server, for ex. EC2 instance (tiny one should suffice).

You can run the project:
```bash
SIGNALING_SERVER_URL="ws://0.0.0.0:9001" trunk serve # comes with awesome hot-reloading
```

If you only want to build the static files:
```bash
SIGNALING_SERVER_URL="ws://0.0.0.0:9001" trunk build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with `index.html` and all the other required files.
You can serve them any way you like.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Allow game restart after it ends
- [ ] Remove disconnected players from the game
- [x] Move JavaScript code to Rust
